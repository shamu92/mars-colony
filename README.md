## Colony App

For this project we created a simple app using AnuglarJS 2.

It is able to get data from a JSON file as well as post it.
This is done in the form of registering a colonist and posting
an alien encounter. 

It has form validation integrated in though ngForm.
It also uses the angular ng-classes to style certain areas
of the app.

The styling was done by using scss files.
